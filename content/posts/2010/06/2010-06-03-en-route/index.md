I accepted a job in New Hampshire and finally have a concrete plan, so I’m now off to India. I left on Tuesday 6/1, and I’ll be back on 7/1.

First off, I had to ship all of my stuff to Pennsylvania. Neither the post office, nor the people standing behind me in line, were thrilled about this choice. But hey, it was about 80% cheaper than using a moving company.

My plan is to head up North to Dharamsala (where the Dalai Llama and the Tibetan Government in Exile reside), then perhaps further Northwest to Leh (which is accessible only in the summer). Jaclyn will then meet in in Delhi around 6/17 and we’ll head down South to Agra, Goa, and Kerala (all beautiful cities).

Here is my provisional To-Do list:

THINGS TO DO

- Get professional golf lessons
- Play golf with a caddie
- Do a 3-day meditation retreat near Dharamsala
- Get a tattoo done the old way (w/out the little tattoo gun)
- Sleep overnight in a second-class sleeper train
- Get a custom-tailored suit
