By Tuesday, I was chomping at the bit to get driving again. I drove 550 miles, and really enjoyed the breathtaking desolation of the scenery and the ease of the driving.

For most of the way through Colorado, I took back-roads (still 65mph speed limit) bordering several national grasslands. Now, National Parks are places so beautiful that we've decided not to let anyone develop them; National Grasslands are places so desolate that nobody could really find a use for them, and consequently we've roped them off and allowed Buffalo and other herd animals to repopulate them. It was really cool to see such a large, desolate grassland, and to think how for eons much of the U.S. had looked that way.  
  
At one point, I happened upon the "Overland Trails History Museum".

It was only $3 admission, and it was actually really, really cool. It had grown from a small WPA project in the 30s to a quite large museum, and in the process had become a bit unfocused. Basically, it just collected all the old crap that nobody wanted within a 30 mile radius, such as furniture, photos, and even entire houses; the back of it was a 13-building villages with in-tact barber shops, barns, farmhouses, and even railroad stations from the turn of the century.

The entire drive was absurdly windy. Winds were 35 mph, but I'm sure the gusts were up to 50mph or more, always coming from the South. Every time I passed a tree or a bridge which broke the wind, the car would lurch 3 ft to the left. I had to look ahead to make sure nothing was near the highway before I passed a Semi, as the crosswinds often pushed them into adjacent lanes. After 550 miles of that bullshit, I was definitely happy to rest for the night.
