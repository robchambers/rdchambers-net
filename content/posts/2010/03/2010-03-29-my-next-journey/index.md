Well, the China blog sure started out strong, but I was much too busy to keep writing entries each day, and by the time the trip was over I could hardly remember what happened.[![](images/Pictures-169x300.jpg)](http://www.rdchambers.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pictures.jpg)  
  
Now, I'm getting ready for a new journey, my first real adventure (minus a couple of days wandering in Japan) since my trip to China. I'll be traveling (hopefully) across the country starting in (about) a few days.  
  
Because I think I set the bar a bit too high with the last blog, this time I'll focus on more posts, less writing, and more pictures.  
  
To that effect, I document my trip to an Ethiopian restaurant in Berkeley to the right. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words...
